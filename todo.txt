slice data 
- i.e aggregate offers at 7 am, whats the std deviation of these offers, average offerat that time of daily
    - use the std dev. to see very consistent bid pattern generators vs erratic bid pattern generators
- have reasonable number of features
- scale/ include all dispatchable output
- if too granular, could move to off peak / on peak, super peak etc.
- determine a way to collapse multiple bid offers into a consice usable dataset, that is consistent across all generators
- prices at set block intervals, i.e. price at 25% capacity, 50% capacity, 75%, so on
- Baseload plants are expensive to startup/shutdown, therefore there is a min. generation needed to make it worth it, often may bid a 0$


- more valuable to have simple analysis on larger set of generators, rather than very complicated analysis on small set of generators
    - exclude wind and solar assets, since they bid in a 0 oftentimes
    - if time allows, we could include them
