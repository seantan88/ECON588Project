- get merit order data into daily form , or collate all intervals of data into a master data set
- then trim dataset(s) to only include combined cycle plants
    - could use list of combined cycle id's to filter





TO ASK:
- Is limiting to just combined cycle plants going to harm our interpretation/results (only 7 combined cycle plants in dataset)
    - There are not many combined cycle plants, most in 1 of 4 regions
    - is this sample size too small?
    - will we be able to observe differences in these plants given that they are already so similar (already same type)

- Feature selection may be impacted by this, as they are all in 1 of 4 regions (calgary, central, northwest, south)
    - feel as though location is not relevant Feature

- exploring using system capability and block price / bid price
    - emily in charge heat rate data, will be added afterwards 

- is using block price appropriate
    - feel as though the other features such as cost derived heat rate, location, etc. will determine the bid price or bid behaviour of the plant
    - will including the block price be 'overlapping' with the other features included


    see if simple cycles operate like combined cycles
    observe low deamdn times, is price higher than normal?
    differing supply conditions
    behaviour chagning 
    is offer behaviour consistent over time or differing? is that market power?


    combine heat rate with prevailing natrual gas price

    competitive price may not always be MC, need to recover fixed costs, dont confuse this with market power
